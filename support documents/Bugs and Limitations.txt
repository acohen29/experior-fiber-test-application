Viavi - Limitations
1) The custom RL button cannot be reclicked after it has already been selected
	Reason: The RL configs buttons are setup as radio buttons
	Possible Fix: Create a cluster of buttons that would mimic the radio buttons but have different properties for custom config
2) The slot number for the Viavi IL/RL Meter is hard coded into the program. This means that all Viavi's must have their respective IL/RL Meters in the same exact positions
	Reason: There is only a single variable in the program that dictates the value for the slot number
	Possible Fix: Have the Viavi SubVI know which viavi is in use (using *IDN) and then have variable slot value based on the device IDN
3) The program does not support having multiple switches connected to a single Map-200
	Reason: There would be no device to test the programming on
	Possible Fix: Have the Viavi SubVI know which viavi is in use (using *IDN) and then have a case structure and switch variable to execute
